# Suggested file syntax:
#
# === (ongoing) ===
# - this is always on top of the file
# - when you release a new version, you rename the last `(ongoing)` to the new
#   version and add a new `=== (ongoing) ===` to the top of the file
#
#
# === 1.0 ===
# - a major version is created when the software reached a milestone and is 
#   feature complete
#
#
# === 0.2 ===
# - a minor version is created when a lot of new features have bene added or
#   significant backwards incompatible changes have been made.
